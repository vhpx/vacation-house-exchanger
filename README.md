## Learning Objectives Assessed

- Object-Oriented Design and Implementation
- Inheritance, Polymorphism and Virtual Functions
- Data Structures (using array, vector and/or linked-list).
- Memory allocation management.
- Usage/Development of software algorithms.
- Development of robust C++ programs.

## Ready for Life and Work

- This assessment contributes to the following program learning outcomes:

  1.1. Comprehensive, theory-based understanding of the underpinning natural and physical sciences and the engineering fundamentals applicable to the engineering discipline.
  1.3. In-depth understanding of specialist bodies of knowledge within the engineering discipline.
  2.1. Application of established engineering methods to complex engineering solving.
  2.2. Fluent application of engineering techniques, tools and resources.
  2.3. Application of systematic engineering synthesis and design processes.

## Submission Instructions

- As a group, submit following files (only one member):

An executable file of your program, i.e. GroupX_Program.exe (where X denotes your group number/name).
A zip file of all source code including .h and .cpp files, i.e. GroupX_Sources.zip.
A report with PDF/ Word format, e.g. GroupX_Report.docx.

- Submit Individual Contribution Form: TBA.

Note: Make sure your executable file can run. If you do not submit it, or it fails to run/crashes, you may lose up to 50% of the grade (although some marks may be given for the effort).
